The recurring issue indicates that the linker is still trying to use an OpenSSL library (`libcrypto.a`) that was not properly cross-compiled for ARM64. Let's double-check and debug systematically.

---

### **1. Root Cause Validation**
The error suggests that:
- The `libcrypto.a` file in `/home/baymax/Downloads/simplex-xmq/deps/openssl-1.1.1u/output/lib` is for a different architecture (e.g., x86_64).
- This happens if:
  - OpenSSL was not successfully cross-compiled.
  - The linker is not using the cross-compiled OpenSSL libraries.

---

### **2. Debugging Steps**

#### **Step 1: Verify Cross-Compiled OpenSSL**
Check the architecture of `libcrypto.a` to confirm it was compiled for ARM64:
```bash
file /home/baymax/Downloads/simplex-xmq/deps/openssl-1.1.1u/output/lib/libcrypto.a
```
Expected output:
```
libcrypto.a: current ar archive
member 1: sha512.o: ELF 64-bit LSB relocatable, ARM aarch64, ...
```
If it is not `ARM aarch64`, the OpenSSL build process was incorrect. In that case:
1. Clean and rebuild OpenSSL:
   ```bash
   cd /home/baymax/Downloads/simplex-xmq/deps/openssl-1.1.1u
   make clean
   ./Configure android-arm64 no-shared no-dso --prefix=$(pwd)/output
   make -j$(nproc)
   make install
   ```

2. Recheck `libcrypto.a` using the `file` command.

---

#### **Step 2: Ensure Cabal Uses Correct Libraries**
Verify that the build environment is pointing to the correct OpenSSL libraries:
```bash
export LIBRARY_PATH=/home/baymax/Downloads/simplex-xmq/deps/openssl-1.1.1u/output/lib
export CPATH=/home/baymax/Downloads/simplex-xmq/deps/openssl-1.1.1u/output/include
```

Test these paths by compiling a simple test program that links against OpenSSL:
```c
#include <openssl/sha.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("OpenSSL SHA512: %s\n", SHA512_version);
    return 0;
}
```
Compile it with the ARM64 toolchain:
```bash
aarch64-linux-android21-clang test.c -o test -L$LIBRARY_PATH -lcrypto -I$CPATH
```
If this fails, the issue is with the OpenSSL libraries.

---

#### **Step 3: Force Cabal to Use Correct Libraries**
Edit the Cabal project file `simplexmq.cabal` and explicitly link against the correct libraries:
1. Find the library linking section for `libcrypto` and `libssl`.
2. Add the full path to your cross-compiled libraries:
   ```haskell
   extra-lib-dirs: /home/baymax/Downloads/simplex-xmq/deps/openssl-1.1.1u/output/lib
   include-dirs: /home/baymax/Downloads/simplex-xmq/deps/openssl-1.1.1u/output/include
   ```
3. Reconfigure Cabal:
   ```bash
   cabal clean
   cabal configure --builddir=build-android --enable-shared
   ```

---

### **3. Test the Build**
Rebuild the project:
```bash
cabal build
```

If the build still fails:
- Run Cabal in verbose mode to gather more details:
  ```bash
  cabal build -v
  ```

---

### **4. Alternative Debugging**
If the above steps fail, there may be residual x86_64 binaries causing conflicts:
1. Remove the `output` directory of OpenSSL and rebuild.
2. Verify that no x86_64 libraries are being picked up during the build process:
   ```bash
   ldd dist-newstyle/build/aarch64-linux-android/ghc-*/simplexmq-*/build/libsimplexmq.so
   ```
