The error you encountered suggests that there is a mismatch in architecture between the dependencies (e.g., `libcrypto.a`) and the target platform (`aarch64` for Android ARM64). Specifically, the static library `libcrypto.a` from OpenSSL appears to have been compiled for a different architecture.

Let's address this systematically.

---

### **1. Root Cause**
The error `unsupported ELF machine number 183` indicates that the linker (`ld`) tried to use a binary compiled for a different architecture (likely x86_64 instead of ARM64). This happened because the OpenSSL library in `deps/openssl-1.1.1u/output/lib` was not cross-compiled for the target platform.

---

### **2. Solution**
You need to:
1. Cross-compile OpenSSL for the Android ARM64 architecture.
2. Ensure the SimplexMQ build process uses the correct OpenSSL libraries.

---

### **3. Steps to Fix**

#### **Step 1: Cross-Compile OpenSSL**
To cross-compile OpenSSL for Android ARM64:
1. Download OpenSSL:
   ```bash
   cd deps
   wget https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.1.1u.tar.gz
   tar -xvzf openssl-1.1.1u.tar.gz
   cd openssl-1.1.1u
   ```

2. Configure OpenSSL for Android ARM64:
   ```bash
   export PATH=$ANDROID_NDK_HOME/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin:$PATH
   export CC=aarch64-linux-android21-clang
   export AR=aarch64-linux-android-ar
   export RANLIB=aarch64-linux-android-ranlib

   ./Configure android-arm64 no-shared no-dso --prefix=$(pwd)/output
   ```

3. Build OpenSSL:
   ```bash
   make -j$(nproc)
   make install
   ```

   After this step, the ARM64 versions of `libcrypto.a` and `libssl.a` will be in the `output/lib` directory.

---

#### **Step 2: Configure Cabal to Use Cross-Compiled OpenSSL**
Update the build environment to ensure SimplexMQ uses the correct OpenSSL libraries:
1. Set `LIBRARY_PATH` and `CPATH` for the cross-compiled OpenSSL:
   ```bash
   export LIBRARY_PATH=$(pwd)/output/lib
   export CPATH=$(pwd)/output/include
   ```

2. Verify paths:
   - `$(pwd)/output/lib` should contain `libcrypto.a` and `libssl.a`.
   - `$(pwd)/output/include` should contain OpenSSL headers.

---

#### **Step 3: Rebuild SimplexMQ**
Return to the root directory of the SimplexMQ repository and rebuild:
```bash
cabal clean
cabal build
```

---

### **4. Verifying the Build**
1. If the build succeeds, the `.so` file will be generated in `dist-newstyle`.
2. Use the `file` command to confirm that the `.so` file is for ARM64:
   ```bash
   file dist-newstyle/build/aarch64-linux-android/ghc-*/simplexmq-*/build/libsimplexmq.so
   ```
   Output should indicate `ARM aarch64`.

---

### **5. Debugging Further Issues**
If you encounter additional errors:
- **OpenSSL linking errors:** Ensure `LIBRARY_PATH` and `CPATH` point to the correct cross-compiled libraries.
- **GHC-specific errors:** Cabal might need additional flags for cross-compilation. Consult the GHC cross-compilation documentation.
